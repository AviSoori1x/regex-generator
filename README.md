# Regex Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/regex-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/regex-generator)

``Regex Generator`` is a tool to generate regular expressions. The goal is that even people with less experience can create regex smoothly.

## Introduction

Regex Generator tries to help you to create a first version of a regular expression to recognize certain texts. It is meant to help people create regular expressions by putting together well-known snippets.

Hopefully nobody will need to use ``substring()`` anymore.

## Demo

Try [Regex Generator](https://noxone.github.io/regex-generator/) online.

## Current Status

``Regex Generator`` has just been published in February 2020. It is still in an initial state and will hopefully grow over time.

In the current state, only a few snippets are supported and the focus of development is primarily on handling and a good user guidance.

## Functionality

Hopefully this regex generator continues to grow to eventually support a really wide range of functions and regular expressions.

### Languages

The ``regex generator`` is currently able to generate code snippets in the following languages:

- C#
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- PHP
- Ruby

If you're missing a language, just create a generator and open a pull-request or simply open a [new issue](https://github.com/noxone/regex-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New+language&template=add-language.md&title=).

### Patterns

At the current stage there are ~20 patterns integrated in ``regex generator``. It is able to find simple patterns as well as very simple repetitions of smaller patterns.

In the final stage this Regex Generator shall support a wide range of use cases. Feel free to suggest new patterns via the [issues](https://github.com/noxone/regex-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=add-pattern.md&title=).

## More ideas

More ideas for new features or how to improve the application are very welcome. Please add them to the Github [issues](https://github.com/noxone/regex-generator/issues).
