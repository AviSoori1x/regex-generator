# Regex Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/regex-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/noxone/regex-generator)

``Regex Generator`` is a tool to generate regular expressions. The goal is that even people with less experience can create regex smoothly.

## Introduction

Regex Generator tries to help you to create a first version of a regular expression to recognize certain texts. It is meant to help people create regular expressions by putting together well-known snippets.

Hopefully nobody will need to use ``substring()`` anymore.

## Current Status

``Regex Generator`` has just been published in February 2020. It is still in an initial state and will hopefully grow over time.

In the current state, only a few snippets are supported and the focus of development is primarily on handling and a good user guidance.

## Try out

Try the one [Regex Generator](https://noxone.github.io/regex-generator/) online.
