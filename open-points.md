# Regex Generator TODOs

## Open Points

1. Add more regex recognizers
1. Add the possibility to edit the sample text directly in step 2 (maybe remove step 1)
1. Once the main logic is done, add some kind of "intro" or "user guide" so new users understand how to use the application. Possible candidates:
    - [driver.js](https://kamranahmed.info/driver.js/)
    - [anno.js](https://github.com/iamdanfox/anno.js)
1. Somehow make Recognizer configurable
